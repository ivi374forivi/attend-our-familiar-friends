# Agent Orchestration Charter

This charter assigns collaboration responsibilities across the agent swarm and documents feedback loops.

## Roles & Owners
- **@Gemini (Experience Lead):** Validate storytelling, motion design, and inclusive UX guidelines.
- **@Copilot (Engineering Lead):** Pair-program core web/mobile components, maintain CI/CD pipelines.
- **@Codex (Architecture Strategist):** Define API contracts, ensure code quality, coordinate complex refactors.
- **OS-Agents (Ops Collective):** Manage infrastructure, observability, and compliance.

## Operating Cadence
| Ritual | Frequency | Facilitator | Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Scope Sync | Twice weekly | @Gemini | Updated design decisions & narrative checks |
| Build Stand-up | Daily | @Copilot | Blocker tracking, deployment readiness |
| Architecture Review | Weekly | @Codex | Approved technical decisions & guardrails |
| Ops Drill | Bi-weekly | OS-Agents | Incident response readiness reports |

## Critique & Complication Loops
1. **Idea Intake:** Capture proposals in `INBOX_AUDIT.md`; assign reviewer within 24 hours.
2. **Critique Session:** Responsible agent challenges assumptions, records notes inline.
3. **Complication Pass:** Secondary agent stress-tests edge cases and integrates risk mitigations.
4. **Resolution:** Outcomes documented in `ROADMAP.md` and `DOC_INDEX.md` cross-links updated.

## Communication Channels
- Repository Discussions → canonical asynchronous updates.
- Shared Calendar → schedule design/dev/ops ceremonies.
- Incident Hotline → dedicated OS-Agents pager for urgent fixes.
