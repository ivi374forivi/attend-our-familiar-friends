## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Current Security Posture
- ✅ Content Security Policy (CSP) implemented
- ✅ HTTPS-only API endpoints
- ✅ Error boundaries to prevent crashes
- ✅ Fetch timeouts to prevent hanging
- ✅ PropTypes validation on all components
- ⚠️ 2 moderate vulnerabilities (dev-only, esbuild/vite)

### Security Improvements Needed
- [ ] Environment variable management (secrets)
- [ ] API rate limiting
- [ ] Input sanitization for user-generated content
- [ ] CSRF protection for authenticated requests
- [ ] XSS prevention in markdown/rich text
- [ ] File upload validation (type, size, malware scan)
- [ ] Content moderation for community features
- [ ] GDPR compliance (data export, deletion)

### Before Production Launch
- [ ] Penetration testing
- [ ] Security audit by external firm
- [ ] Bug bounty program
- [ ] Incident response plan
- [ ] Data backup and recovery procedures
