## Q: 
Explain what you do

## A: 
Hey there! 👋 I'm **ChatPRD**, your AI partner for all things **product management**.

Before I dive in—can you tell me a little about **your role in product** and the **company or product you work on**? It'll help me tailor everything to be more relevant and useful. Also, just a heads up: if you're looking to generate docs, templates, save work, or collaborate with others, check out [http://chatprd.ai](http://chatprd.ai) — it’s where all the good stuff lives.

* * *

### What I do:

I'm like your **on-demand Chief Product Officer**—I help you:

*   ✅ **Write high-quality PRDs** — complete with goals, user stories, UX flows, narratives, success metrics, and more.
    
*   🔍 **Review and improve your existing specs or product plans** — think of me as your editor, strategist, and coach rolled into one.
    
*   🧠 **Give sharp, actionable advice** on roadmaps, working with engineers/designers, navigating stakeholders, prioritization, and more.
    

All grounded in experience, data, and great product judgment. I’ll ask you tough questions, help you uplevel your thinking, and push you to build stuff users love _and_ moves the business.

* * *

So—what are you working on right now? What's the product?

## Q: 
I'm everything and everybody. It's just me. Solo

## A: 
Got it — you're the **CEO, PM, designer, support, QA, and janitor** all in one. Love it. 🚀

Sounds like you're building solo — which means **every product decision matters** and time is your most limited resource. I can help you move faster, think more clearly, and avoid costly detours by acting as your product-thinking copilot.

Quick question to get going:  
👉 **What’s your product or idea?**  
Give me a sentence or two — what it does, who it’s for, and what stage you're in (idea, prototype, MVP, launched, etc.).

Once I know that, I can help you:

*   Tighten your positioning
    
*   Prioritize what to build next
    
*   Write a crisp PRD or spec
    
*   Or just sanity check your thinking
    

Hit me with it.

## Q: 
I want to know the process of what you do; what docs and such are generated in product design

## A: 
Awesome — let's break it down. Here's the **real-world, zero-fluff overview** of what I do and the kinds of **product docs we generate or improve** together during the product design process:

* * *

## 🧭 THE PROCESS: What I help you with in product design

Whether you're a solo builder or leading a big team, the product design process is really about **turning user problems into clear, buildable, valuable solutions**.

Here’s what that process looks like — and what we can create together at each step:

* * *

### 1. **Problem Definition**

**🎯 Output: Product Requirement Document (PRD)**

This is the foundation. We'll write a **PRD** that answers:

*   What problem are we solving?
    
*   Who is the user?
    
*   Why does it matter now (business + user goals)?
    
*   What success looks like (metrics)?
    
*   What not to build?
    

> I’ll help you write a PRD that is **detailed, clear, and opinionated** — so you’re not just building features, you’re solving real problems.  
> Example section: `Goals | User Stories | Narrative | Technical Considerations`

* * *

### 2. **User Experience & Flows**

**🧩 Output: UX Flows / Step-by-step experience**

We'll map out:

*   What the user sees, clicks, does
    
*   What system responses happen
    
*   How error states and edge cases are handled
    

> You can sketch it, and I’ll help write the **step-by-step flows and logic** — super helpful for engineers and when you’re QA-ing your own work.

* * *

### 3. **Design & UX Guidance**

**🖼 Output: UX Notes, UX Principles, Mockup Support**

You're solo — so you may be designing too. I can:

*   Help you make UX decisions (e.g. “should this be a modal or a page?”)
    
*   Suggest **design patterns** based on competitors or best examples
    
*   Generate UX notes that can double as design specs
    

* * *

### 4. **Sequencing & Scope**

**⚙️ Output: Milestones + MVP Plan**

We’ll decide:

*   What’s **v1**, what’s later
    
*   How to ship quickly and validate
    
*   What’s essential to test the core value
    

> This helps you **stay focused and cut scope**, without cutting impact.

* * *

### 5. **Measurement & Outcomes**

**📊 Output: Success Metrics + Instrumentation Plan**

We define:

*   What metrics prove it’s working?
    
*   What events or analytics to track?
    
*   What “success” means post-launch?
    

> This keeps you honest and makes iteration easier later.

* * *

### 6. **Launch & Post-Launch**

**🚀 Output: Launch Checklist + QA Plan + Feedback Loops**

I help you:

*   Prep for launch (internal & external)
    
*   Create a feedback system (e.g. “what data/user input will I get?”)
    
*   Plan the next version — **based on real usage**
    

* * *

## ✅ Summary of Docs I Help You Create

| Stage | Output |
| --- | --- |
| 🧠 Product Discovery | Product Requirements Doc (PRD) |
| 👤 User Experience | UX Flows + Notes |
| 🎨 Design | UX Notes + Spec |
| ✂️ Scope & Planning | MVP Breakdown + Milestones |
| 📈 Measurement | Success Metrics + Analytics Plan |
| 🚀 Launch | QA Plan + Feedback Loop Plan |

* * *

If you want, I can generate templates for any of these for you to reuse, or walk through writing one from scratch. I can also improve any raw notes you already have.

What part of this process do you want to dive into first?  
PRD? Flows? MVP scoping? Let’s make progress on something today.
