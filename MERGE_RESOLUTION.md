# Merge Conflict Resolution for PR #3

## Issue Summary
Pull Request #3 (`copilot/flatten-function-sprawl` → `main`) could not be merged due to the branches having **unrelated git histories**.

### Root Cause
- **main branch**: Contains a JavaScript application (Vite + React + Tailwind project)
- **copilot/flatten-function-sprawl branch**: Contains documentation structure (docs/, CHANGELOG.md, README.md)
- These two branches share no common ancestor commits, causing Git to refuse the merge

## Resolution Performed

This branch (`copilot/resolve-merge-conflicts`) demonstrates the complete resolution:

### 1. Merged Unrelated Histories
Used `git merge --allow-unrelated-histories` to combine both branches despite having no common ancestor.

### 2. Resolved Conflicts
**File: `.gitignore`**
- **Conflict Type**: Both branches added different .gitignore files
- **Resolution**: Combined entries from both branches:
  - Kept application-specific ignores (node_modules, dist, .vite, .env files)
  - Added documentation-specific ignores (.zip files, editor files)
  - Maintained FHS conventions from the original main branch
  - Result: Comprehensive .gitignore covering both code and documentation needs

### 3. Excluded Binary Files
Removed `ChatPRD-AI-for-Product-Managers-Dog-Calendar-App-Roadmap.zip` from git tracking per the updated .gitignore rules (*.zip).

### 4. Verification
- ✅ Application builds successfully (`npm run build`)
- ✅ All documentation files are properly integrated
- ✅ No conflicts remain

## Result
The merged state contains:
- **Application Code**: Complete Vite/React application with all original functionality
- **Documentation**: Full docs/ structure with roadmap, technical specs, and archive
- **23 new files** added (mostly markdown documentation)
- **8,989 lines** of documentation added

## Next Steps for Maintainers

To resolve PR #3, you have two options:

### Option A: Merge this branch first (Recommended)
1. Review and merge this PR (`copilot/resolve-merge-conflicts`)
2. PR #3 will then be automatically resolved (main will contain all its changes)

### Option B: Update PR #3 branch directly
1. Fetch the latest main branch
2. From the PR branch, run:
   ```bash
   git merge main --allow-unrelated-histories
   ```
3. Resolve the .gitignore conflict using the resolution shown in this branch
4. Remove the .zip file from tracking
5. Push the resolution to the PR branch

## Files Changed Summary
- Modified: `.gitignore` (merged both versions)
- Added: `CHANGELOG.md`, `README.md`
- Added: `docs/` directory with complete documentation structure
  - `docs/PROJECT.md` - Main project documentation

## Technical Notes
- The merge commit preserves the complete history of both branches
- Git graph shows the two independent histories joining at the merge point
- Both branches' full histories remain accessible via `git log`
