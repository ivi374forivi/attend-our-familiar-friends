# Attend Our Familiar Friends

A centralized workspace for the DogTale Daily product initiative, combining requirement drafts, troubleshooting notes, and strategic planning artifacts.

## Repository Structure

- `ChatPRD/` — Imported product requirement and brainstorming documents. See `ChatPRD/README.md` for curation rules.
- `DOC_INDEX.md` — Cross-reference map for every knowledge artifact in the repository.
- `ROADMAP.md` — Delivery plan and milestones aligned with upcoming releases.
- `AGENT_ORCHESTRATION.md` — Task routing and ownership across collaborating agents.
- `ANNOTATED_BIBLIOGRAPHY.md` — External research on adjacent implementations and inspiration repos.
- `ECOSYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md` — Surrounding tools, rituals, and governance practices.

## Operating Rhythm

1. Capture new information in domain-specific files under `ChatPRD/` and register it in `DOC_INDEX.md`.
2. Record planning decisions, risks, and deliverables within `ROADMAP.md`.
3. Use `AGENT_ORCHESTRATION.md` to assign owners (@Gemini, @Copilot, @Codex, OS-Agents) and track cross-agent review loops.
4. Reference `ANNOTATED_BIBLIOGRAPHY.md` and `ECOSYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md` for best-practice alignment.

## Next Steps

- Validate remaining data ingestion requirements and identify missing historical context.
- Stand up automation to monitor new uploads and auto-update the documentation set.
- Prepare initial progress report summarizing completed merges (current branch already synchronized).
