# DogTale Daily Delivery Roadmap

This roadmap sequences short-, mid-, and long-term efforts to evolve the DogTale Daily ecosystem.

## Phase 0 — Stabilize Knowledge Base (Week 0)
- [x] Ingest legacy documentation into version control.
- [x] Normalize AI handoff headers and footers.
- [ ] Automate ingestion of new uploads into `ChatPRD/` via watch scripts.

## Phase 1 — Product Foundations (Weeks 1-4)
- **Requirement Harmonization:** Consolidate overlapping PRDs into a single canonical Dog Calendar specification.

## Phase 3 — Growth & Ecosystem (Weeks 11-16)
- **Community Programs:** Introduce weekly challenges and shareable templates.
- **Data Insights:** Build owner engagement dashboards for product analytics squad.
- **Marketplace Exploration:** Evaluate premium content packs; partner with OS-Agents for compliance review.

## Sustaining Activities
