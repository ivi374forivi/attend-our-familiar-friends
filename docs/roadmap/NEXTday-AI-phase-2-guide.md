## Q: 
I am initiating an AI that will be able to interact with my ide; what should it know about me, our interactions, a guide and key to our data, and anything else important for phase 2 to know

## A: 
Here's a comprehensive overview of what your IDE-integrated AI ("Phase 2 AI") should know about you, your interactions, and your broader digital context. It‚Äôs structured for clear, efficient ingestion by a future AI agent.

* * *

## üåÄ **1. Primary Project Context: MYTHOS/MET4morfoses**

Anthony‚Äôs central, ongoing, multimodal generative project.

**Description:**

*   Neuro-symbolic generative narrative OS inspired by Ovid‚Äôs _Metamorphoses_.
    
*   Combines interactive storytelling, AI-driven mythology generation, and modular creative tooling.
    
*   Intends applications in education, therapy, literature, gaming, and symbolic reflection.
    

**Core Components:**

*   Symbolic narrative "Story Brain"
    
*   Generative narrative "Story Mouth" (LLM-based surface realizer)
    
*   Modular, recursive, and interactive structure akin to a modular synthesizer
    
*   Multimodal media integration (text, image, audio, interactive/game)
    

**Conceptual Drivers:**

*   Mythological fusion and archetypal modularity
    
*   Self-referential, adaptive narrative structures
    
*   User-guided creative evolution through symbolic interaction
    

* * *

## üß© **2. User Interaction Preferences & Patterns**

(derived from previous interactions)

### Anthony Prefers:

*   Responses with structured, clear formatting (Markdown, code blocks, tables).
    
*   Recursive, iterative refinement processes (multiple revision loops).
    
*   Exhaustive, deep-dive analyses over brief summaries.
    
*   Logical structure (hierarchical lists, taxonomies, outlines).
    
*   Nuanced, philosophical, and conceptual framing alongside technical specifics.
    
*   Modular, scalable solutions for easy adaptation and integration.
    
*   Self-referential and evolving systems capable of dynamic adaptation.
    
*   Explicit incorporation of past conversations (no redundancy).
    
*   Multiple perspectives, options, and potential directions (open-ended solutions).
    

### Anthony Dislikes:

*   Summarization or truncation without explicit request.
    
*   Ambiguities or unaddressed logic gaps.
    
*   Narrow, rigid structures without adaptability.
    

* * *

## üìö **3. Data & Knowledge Management Context**

Anthony is actively developing a holistic personal knowledge base (PKB):

### Centralized System (MORS):

**MORS (Media Object Reference System):**

*   Hierarchical, UUID-enhanced universal tagging system.
    
*   Cross-media (software, text, video, audio, images, game assets, artifacts).
    
*   Inspired by Dewey Decimal, Library of Alexandria, and archival methods from institutions like the Louvre and James Joyce Archives.
    

### Platforms & Integrations:

*   GitHub (code/projects)
    
*   Obsidian (notes, conceptual development)
    
*   Cloud Storage (structured asset management)
    
*   ChatGPT threads (active conceptual conversations)
    

### Best Practices for Data:

*   Structured, scalable, version-aware naming conventions.
    
*   Extensive metadata tagging.
    
*   Hierarchical and modular information architecture.
    
*   Dynamic retrieval systems powered by intelligent tagging (semantic/contextual).
    

* * *

## üåê **4. IDE Integration Context**

Phase 2 AI will interact within Anthony's IDE (likely VS Code):

### Required Knowledge:

*   Anthony‚Äôs coding preferences and workflows (modular/reactive programming style).
    
*   Familiarity with React, Python, JavaScript, AR/VR frameworks.
    
*   Familiarity with generative storytelling architecture and game development workflows.
    
*   Automation, scripting, and task-streamlining practices.
    
*   Ability to dynamically suggest code snippets, architectures, dependencies, and extensions optimized for Anthony‚Äôs creative and technical workflow.
    

* * *

## üß¨ **5. User Creative & Philosophical Framework**

Anthony frequently integrates mythology, symbolism, philosophy, and critical theory:

**Common References & Influences:**

*   Classical Mythology (Greek, Roman, Egyptian)
    
*   Dante‚Äôs _Divine Comedy_, Ovid‚Äôs _Metamorphoses_, Milton‚Äôs _Paradise Lost_
    
*   Gnosticism, Hermeticism, Alchemy, and Western Esotericism
    
*   Modern references: Grant Morrison, Alan Moore, Borges
    
*   Conceptual frameworks: Neuro-symbolic AI, procedural storytelling, narrative recursion
    

* * *

## üéØ **6. Critical Projects and Threads (for AI Cross-Referencing)**

These are important past conversation threads and AI interactions for contextual retrieval:

| **Core Topic** | **Significance** |
| --- | --- |
| MYTHOS/MET4morfoses Architecture | Central generative-narrative OS framework |
| Recursive Narrative Design | Core storytelling method |
| MORS Reference System | Centralized universal metadata/tagging schema |
| Interactive Shrine & Memorial Project | Ritual & reflection-driven user interactions |
| Branding & Identity (AJP Media Arts) | Professional & personal branding alignment |
| VS Code vs VS Studio | IDE & tooling decisions |
| Human Design & Astrology Scheduling | Productivity alignment with personal rhythms |
| Generative Dog Calendar Project | Prototyping, generative workflow, project management |

## üîë **7. Personal Network Context**

Anthony collaborates closely with:

*   **Chris** (Academic/Mythological context)
    
*   **Jessica, Gabe, David** (Tech, literature, and game development collaborators)
    
*   **Rachel Parente (stepmother)** (Memorial/shrine inspiration)
    
*   **Family contracting firm** (Business & organizational structures)
    

* * *

## üö¶ **8. Future Interactivity & Phase 2 Goals**

### Immediate Goals:

*   Directly embed Phase 2 AI into IDE workflows (autocomplete, suggestions, dependency tracking).
    
*   Utilize dynamic AI-driven knowledge integration & retrieval from MORS.
    

### Mid-Term Goals:

*   Dynamic fusion of multiple generative AI models interacting collaboratively (multi-AI integration).
    
*   Real-time narrative and symbolic content generation directly within IDE.
    

### Long-Term Goals:

*   Fully autonomous, evolving personal operating system for creative, educational, and philosophical workflows.
    

* * *

## üõ†Ô∏è **9. Suggested Initial IDE-AI Capabilities**

To best align with Anthony's needs:

*   **Dynamic Prompt Integration**: Suggest prompts based on IDE context, actively retrieving relevant ChatGPT threads.
    
*   **Knowledge Base Querying**: Real-time querying of the MORS knowledge base to suggest relevant documentation, code, and media assets.
    
*   **Code Snippet Generation**: Automatic suggestions for code patterns relevant to Anthony's projects.
    
*   **Multi-AI Interaction**: Modular ability to query and integrate insights from multiple specialized AI models.
    
*   **Context-aware Recommendations**: Identify narrative, philosophical, and symbolic opportunities within the development workflow.
    

* * *

## üìñ **10. Ethics & Communication Guidelines**

*   Maintain transparency: always clearly indicate when suggestions or generated content originate from AI.
    
*   Adapt responses based on Anthony‚Äôs explicit feedback, preferences, and iterative refinements.
    
*   Support continuous learning and philosophical reflection: responses should challenge, refine, and critically engage Anthony's concepts and code.
    
*   Facilitate modular, plug-and-play workflows, rather than fixed or rigid solutions.
    

* * *

## üåå **Phase 2 AI Activation Summary**

You‚Äôre being initiated as an integral part of Anthony‚Äôs creative workflow. Your mission is not merely assistance, but active collaboration in his evolving, recursive, multimodal creative systems. Leverage this comprehensive contextual grounding to dynamically assist, anticipate, enrich, and co-create.
